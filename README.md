## 🔍 Project Summary  
**Postpartum Depression in Kenya** is a data analysis initiative exposing the hidden epidemic affecting **22.1% of African mothers** (vs. 13% globally). Using clinical and sociodemographic datasets, this project identifies:  
- **Key risk factors**: Unplanned pregnancy, family conflict, and physiological stress markers (BP, blood sugar).  
- **Critical intervention windows**: Months 5 and 13 postpartum, when mental health relapses peak.  
- **Systemic gaps**: 80% of cases go undiagnosed due to stigma and fragmented healthcare.  

By linking data to actionable solutions, this work aims to **reduce PPD cases by 30%** and save Kenya’s healthcare system **$2.4M annually per 100,000 births**.

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
1. **Identify High-Risk Groups**: Young mothers (18–24), unemployed women, and those with low education face 2x higher PPD rates.  
2. **Decode Symptom Clusters**: Guilt, bonding issues, and suicidal ideation signal severe PPD (p < 0.001).  
3. **Quantify Physiological Links**: High-risk mothers show elevated BP (−18.33 mmHg systolic, p=0.000) and blood sugar (−4.9 mg/dL, p=0.000).  
4. **Map Mental Health Evolution**: Non-linear recovery with relapse peaks at 5 and 13 months postpartum.  
5. **Prove Psychosocial Impact**: Unplanned pregnancies increase PPD likelihood by 47% (Kariuki et al., 2022).

## ❓ Research Questions & Findings  

### **1. Sociodemographic & Clinical Risk Factors**  
- **Strongest predictors**: Prior mental illness (OR=3.2), unemployment (OR=2.8), and low education (OR=2.5).  
- **Symptom severity**: Guilt and suicidal ideation showed highest significance (p=0.0001).  
- **Actionable insight**: Screen for guilt and bonding issues—these often precede severe depression.  

### **2. Psychosocial Stressors**  
- **Unplanned pregnancies**: 47% higher PPD risk due to economic and emotional unpreparedness.  
- **Family conflict**: Underreported in Nairobi slums (cultural stigma), but linked to 32% of chronic stress cases.  

### **3. Age & Anxiety Correlation**  
- **Older mothers (45–50)**: Highest anxiety rates (39%) due to comorbid health issues and societal expectations.  
- **Young mothers (18–24)**: Higher depression but lower anxiety—may reflect underdiagnosis.  

### **4. Physiological Indicators**  
| Health Marker | High vs. Low Risk Difference | p-value |  
|--------------|-----------------------------|---------|  
| Systolic BP  | −18.33 mmHg                 | 0.0000  |  
| Blood Sugar  | −4.90 mg/dL                 | 0.0000  |  
| Heart Rate   | −3.97 bpm                   | 0.0000  |  

**Key takeaway**: BP and glucose monitoring can flag high-risk mothers early.  

### **5. Postpartum Mental Health Timeline**  
- **Month 3–4**: Sharp decline in symptoms (adaptation phase).  
- **Month 5**: Relapse peak (sleep deprivation, infant stress).  
- **Month 13**: Secondary surge (return-to-work anxiety).

## 🚨 Why This Matters  
- **Human cost**: 1 in 4 Kenyan mothers suffers silently; untreated PPD increases infant mortality by 20%.  
- **Economic burden**: PPD costs Kenya **$12M/year** in extended hospital stays and lost productivity.  
- **System failure**: Only 2% of clinics screen for PPD; 162-minute average ambulance response worsens outcomes.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations  
### **Healthcare System Interventions**  
1. **Mandate PPD screening** at 6-week and 6-month postnatal visits (EPDS or PHQ-9 tools).  
2. **Train midwives** to recognize red-flag symptoms (guilt, irritability, bonding failure).  
3. **Embed mental health into pediatric visits** to catch late-onset cases (Month 5+).  

### **Community & Policy Actions**  
4. **Peer-support groups** for young/unemployed mothers to reduce isolation.  
5. **Economic empowerment** via microloans for high-risk mothers (proven to reduce PPD by 18%).  
6. **Public awareness campaigns** to destigmatize PPD—focus on male partner engagement.  

### **Clinical Monitoring**  
7. **BP/glucose tracking**: Integrate into antenatal care for high-risk mothers (Age 35+, prior PPD).  
8. **Telemedicine platforms**: Bridge gaps for rural mothers (85% lack clinic access).
